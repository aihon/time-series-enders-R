# Since we want to test Granger causality both of "domestic" on "transnational" and "transnational" on "domestic" we want first
# see if the two series are stationary. In order to do that we perform a DF (Dickey-Fuller) test and a ERS (from Elliott, 
# Rothenberg, and Stock [1996]) test generally known as Dickeyâ€“Fuller generalized least squares (DF-GLS) test.
# First we have to select the lag lenght of the model and to do that we can use the general-to-specific method or the
# function AIC() and BIC() applied at the models estimated with different lag lenght and choose the model that have the smaller
# value of taht functions.

# DF and DF-GLS for Domestic
dfDom = ur.df(newDataset$Domestic, type = c("drift"),  lags = 2)            # -2.5144

summary(dfTrans) # reject
ersTrans = ur.ers(newDataset$Transnational, type = c("DF-GLS"), lag.max = 1) # -2.5164 
summary(ersTrans) # reject

# Now we want to test the Granger causality in both directions.
# To do that we have to select the lag lenght of the VAR.
