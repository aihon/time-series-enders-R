# time-series-enders-R

In this repository you can find excercices from Enders (2015) *Applied Econometric Times Series* 4th ed. solved in R.

Chapter *i* excercises are in the *chapteri* folder.

Data are taken from [here](http://time-series.net/data_sets).

In order to compile the *.R files you need to have R installed in your computer. I also suggest to install RStudio. [Here](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~gulzar/rstudio/index.html) you can find a tutorial both to install R and RStudio.
